  Nakamoto is set to be instantiated on mainnet on April 16th, at block 839,444.
  Remember that Nakamoto is being rolled out in two phases, and this represents
  the first phase.

# Nakamoto for Stackers

Stackers, here’s what you need to be ready for the first of 2 forks that will [bring us the Nakamoto upgrade](https://docs.stacks.co/nakamoto-upgrade/nakamoto-rollout-plan)!

* Your STX will automatically unlock at Bitcoin block 839,444 (approximately April 16th)
* Despite your STX being unlocked before the end of Cycle 82, you will still earn the full rewards from the cycle.
* There are no frozen cycles, so you can immediately re-Stack after the upgrade
* Given the timing of the upgrade, you’ll only have about 3 days to initiate Stacking for Cycle 83.
* The [tight turnaround](nakamoto-for-stackers.md#why-the-tight-turnaround-for-cycle-83) means that **not all Stacking providers will be ready to serve you**. Pools that will be ready for Cycle 83 will be listed here. Please message _signers@stacks.org_ if your pool will be avialable for users in Cycle 83.
  * Coming soon
  * Coming soon
  * Coming soon

#### Rewards in Cycle 83

Unlike previous major updates, core developers have left Stackers a decent chance at not having any missed reward cycles. The determining factor for whether or not rewards will be paid in Cycle 83 is if enough STX (73M PoX minimum) can be locked in time. Whether or not that happens will be determined both by how quickly Stacking pools can upgrade to support the new pox contract and then if users are able to Stack enough total for the cycle. Core contributors and the Stacks Foundation have offered support to pools in hopes the minimum can be met for Cycle 83. If the minimum is not achieved, the upgrade will proceed much as those before it with a proof of burn cycle for Cycle 83. PoX and BTC rewards would then reactivate for the next cycle after which the 73M threshold is reached.

<summary>Why the tight turnaround for Cycle 83?</summary>

While not ideal timing for pool operators, the chosen Bitcoin block was the earliest block within the Instantiation window the core developers felt comfortable with the release and consistent feedback from builders is that the faster Nakamoto can be shipped, the better. While it didn’t leave a lot of time for pools to be upgraded for Cycle 83, many have been working on testnet and can be ready. Considering all the factors, it’s likely the net benefit to the ecosystem for shipping sooner is much greater than the potential downside of one proof-of-burn cycle for the upgrade. Further, a missed cycle for major upgrades has been the expected standard - that there is a decent chance we may not skip one at all is a great bonus goal for the network to try and achieve.
