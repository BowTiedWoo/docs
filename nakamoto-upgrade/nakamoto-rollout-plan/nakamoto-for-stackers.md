# Nakamoto for Stackers

The current projection for the Instantiation step of the Nakamoto rollout is \~April 22nd at Bitcoin block 840,360. You can check the [real-time projection here](https://stacks-network.github.io/when-activation/2.5/).  Remember that Nakamoto is being rolled out in two phases, and this represents the first phase.

***

Stackers, hereâ€™s what you need to be ready for the first of 2 forks that will [bring us the Nakamoto upgrade](https://docs.stacks.co/nakamoto-upgrade/nakamoto-rollout-plan)!

* Your STX will automatically unlock at Bitcoin block 840,360 (approximately April 22nd)
* Despite your STX being unlocked for Cycle 83, you will still earn the full rewards from the cycle
* There are no frozen cycles, so you can immediately re-Stack after the upgrade
* You will have all of Cycle 83 to initiate Stacking for Cycle 84. Follow updates from your Stacking provider/pool to be notified when they are ready to receive your new Stacking calls for Cycle 84

**Reminder:** The network does not _**depend**_ on Signers for block production until the second hard fork expected in May. Learn More: [https://docs.stacks.co/nakamoto-upgrade/nakamoto-rollout-plan](https://docs.stacks.co/nakamoto-upgrade/nakamoto-rollout-plan)

## Stacks (STX) Holders

The upgrade is simple for you, you don't have to do anything. No token transfers, etc. For most of you, your wallets will be upgraded automatically and you'll be on the upgraded network without even realizing there was a change.&#x20;

In terms of buying/trading/withdrawing, exchanges _may_ briefly suspend STX-related activities, as they upgrade their nodes. Communicating a deposit/withdrawal suspension is the typical process, but in practice, these suspensions are either very brief or don't end up happening at all assuming their upgrade went smoothly. If an exchange decides to suspend activity they will communicate this to you directly. Again, typically these suspensions are quite brief and most exchanges don't suspend at all. If you have an issue with your exchange, please get in touch with them directly.&#x20;
