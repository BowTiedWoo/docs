The Nakamoto Release is an upcoming hard fork on the Stacks network designed to bring several benefits, chief among them are increased transaction throughput and 100% Bitcoin finality.

The Nakamoto release brings many new capabilities and improvements to the Stacks blockchain by focusing on a set of core advancements: improving transaction speed, enhancing finality guarantees for transactions, mitigating Bitcoin miner MEV (miner extractable value) opportunities that affect PoX, and boosting robustness against chain reorganizations.

This portion of the documentation is broken up into several sections.

## How Nakamoto Works

## Controlled Testnet

Neon is the currently released controlled testnet that is available for us. It actually comes with two testnets, one which uses the new ClarityWASM VM (one of the components of Nakamoto) and one that uses the current Clarity VM.

Argon is the next testnet to be released, slated for late February.

Neon is available to be used now, get more details on the [Neon docs page](/docs/nakamoto/neon).

Expect frequent changes to the testnets as it will be upgraded quite often.
