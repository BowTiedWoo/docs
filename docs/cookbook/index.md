The Stacks Cookbook is a collection of sample apps and smart contracts to serve as starting points and references for building your own Stacks apps. It is currently a work in progress. Here is some of the content we have planned and we welcome [contributions](../contribute/).

Many of these cookbook recipes have been pulled from other tutorials and linked here for easy access. Links to full tutorials and sample code have been included for reference and further exploration.

Got an idea you think would make a good addition? We're always [accepting contributions](../contribute/).
