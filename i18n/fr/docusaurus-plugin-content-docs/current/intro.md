# Stacks Docs

**Stacks is Bitcoin L2 that brings smart contract functionality to Bitcoin, without modifying Bitcoin itself.**

These docs serve as:

1. An introduction to Stacks (what it is, why you should care, how to build Bitcoin apps with it),
2. A reference guide to various aspects of the Stacks ecosystem
3. A collection of tutorials and code samples to help you learn and build

If you see something you think you might want to contribute, [please do so](/docs/contribute)! We are always looking for good contributions from the community.

:::note
Stacks is currently in the middle of a major upgrade called the Nakamoto Release. The next section is dedicated to describing how Nakamoto works and the benefits it brings.

Keep in mind that other sections of this documentation apply to the pre-Nakamoto version of Stacks, and will be updated when it is released.
:::

## Nakamoto

The Nakamoto Release is an upcoming hard fork on the Stacks network designed to bring several benefits, chief among them are increased transaction throughput and 100% Bitcoin finality. Nakamoto is designed to make Stacks a true Bitcoin L2 and further unlock the decentralized Bitcoin economy.

## Tutorials

Looking to understand how to build full-stack Bitcoin dapps with Stacks? These tutorials will give you a solid introduction. At the moment we have an intro tutorial and a collection of community-created tutorials focusing on Stacks and Clarity specifically, with a comprehensive deep-dive tutorial series covering Bitcoin-first development on the way.

## Stacks Academy

If you are looking to understand Stacks and what it's all about at a deeper level, Stacks Academy is the place to go.

## Clarity Reference

Clarity is the language that powers smart contracts built on Stacks. You'll be introduced to Clarity in Stacks Academy, but this section of the docs is where you can find the references for all the keywords and functions in Clarity.

## Nodes and Miners

Interested in mining or running a Stacks node? This section is where you'll learn what that looks like and how to set it up.

## Gaia

Gaia is a unique approach to off-chain data storage that focuses on user-ownership of data with access connected to a Stacks identity.

## Cookbook

The Cookbook is a WIP, but you can check out what we have available now. This is designed to be a collection of code snippets, mini tutorials, and sample projects designed to help you accomplish specific things with Stacks.

## Next Steps

Apply for a grant, get a job, start a company, join an immersive education experience like Clarity Universe. This section will point you to the different places in the Stacks community you can launch and grow your career as a Stacks developer.
